<p><strong>The Deep Cuts</strong> is a DJing philosophy guide disguised as a technical manual. Structured as a modular curriculum, it teaches mixing, phrasing, harmonic blending, and energy controlâ€”not for clubs, but for personal connection.</p>
<p>This is a guide for people who make mixes the way others write letters.</p>
