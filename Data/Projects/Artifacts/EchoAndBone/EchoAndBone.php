<p><strong>Echo & Bone</strong> is a visual triptych exploring the Stoic principles of <em>Amor Fati</em>, <em>Memento Mori</em>, and <em>Summum Bonum</em>.</p>
<p>Created in Procreate using custom halftone brushes, the series mimics the texture and tone of vintage PSA postersâ€”bleached by time, but still resonant. The typography is Swiss-influenced, typeset with restraint and clarity.</p>
<p>Rather than treating Stoicism as cold or detached, this series invites a softer reading: death as a mirror for clarity, love of fate as participation, and virtue as design.</p>
