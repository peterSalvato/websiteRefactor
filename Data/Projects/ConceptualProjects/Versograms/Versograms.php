<p><strong>Versograms</strong> are lyric posters designed like Polaroids—each one a frozen moment of sound. Built on Swiss grid principles with dynamic type treatments, each print honors a single track that shaped the artist’s emotional life.</p>
<p>Posters are designed in vertical SX-70 format and printed using textured halftones and restrained palettes.</p>
